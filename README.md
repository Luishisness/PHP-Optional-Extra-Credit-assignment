 PHP Optional Assignment (Extra Credit) - Online Quiz

Pick a topic (e.g. your favorite sport, current movies, or any other category of trivia you can think of!)

Build an on-line quiz of at least 6 questions for your users.

Your program should calculate the user’s score by evaluating their answers and giving them a response. For example:

Sample output 
You got 6 out of 6 right. Great job!  

Sample output 
You only got 3 right. That was awful!
Guidelines and Hints:

This assignment will result in two webpages: the first page will be a data entry form for the user’s responses to your questions; the second page will report on their answers … and the correct answer for every answer that they got wrong. Use comments in your PHP code to explain key calculations and steps.
